# NBA-Trends-Project-Using-Python
Analysing data relating to the National Basketball Association (NBA) to find associations between teams, winning trends, etc.

## Introduction:

The aim of this project is to analyse data from the NBA (National Basketball Association) to explore possible trends and associations.

## Brief Description of  the  Data:

The data was originally sourced from 538's Analysis of the Complete History Of The NBA and contains the original, unmodified data from Basketball Reference as well as several additional variables 538 added to perform their own analysis.
For this project, we have limited the data to only 5 teams and 10 columns (plus one constructed column, point_diff, the difference between pts and opp_pts).
